                                Hello, my name is Jonah Davies, a 20 year old undergraduate fashion student from Hastings, East Sussex. Since a young age Iâ€™ve always been interested in print design and graphics , stemming from both parents being heavily involved in the arts.Hard work within pressured environments comes naturally to me, having worked in intense environments since I was 14, having to deliver to a high level of expectation and satisfaction. I have a creative outlook on industry, often looking at tasks with an alternate perspective, whilst still delivering on brief and punctuality. Both parents are from creative backgrounds so I have been nurtured on creative practise such as print and illustration, with a keen eye for composition and graphical qualities. Although experience within fashion maybe lighter than others my determination would make me a true asset as I will always learn on the spot and be ready to be tasked with anything.
