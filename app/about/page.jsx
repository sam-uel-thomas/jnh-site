                        Hello, my name is Jonah Davies, a 21-year-old undergraduate fashion student from Hastings, East Sussex. Since a young age, Iâ€™ve always been interested in print design and graphics, stemming from both parents being heavily involved in the arts. Hard work within pressured environments comes naturally to me, having worked in intense environments since I was 14, having to deliver to a high level of expectation and satisfaction. I have a creative outlook on industry, often looking at tasks with an alternate perspective, whilst still delivering on brief and punctuality. Both parents are from creative backgrounds, so I have been nurtured on creative practice such as print and illustration, with a keen eye for composition and graphical qualities. Although experience within fashion may be lighter than others, my determination would make me a true asset as I will always learn on the spot and be ready to be tasked with anything.
